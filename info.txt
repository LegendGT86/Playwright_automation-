✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅//Setting up your repo✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅
1) create a repo on Github via the website
2) Open VS Code and initialize your local repo {File → Open Folder → select your project folder}
3) Open terminal in VS code {Ctrl + `}
4) Add all files {git add .}
5) Commit your first version {git commit -m "Initial commit"}
6) Connect to github remote {git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-project.git} 
7) Create main branch {git branch -M main}  --> capital 'M' forces name change, lowercase would try to rename but fail if branch alterady exists
8) Push to main {git push -u origin main}

9) If you want to create a branch, you can use checkout or rather the newer switch (git switch -c feature/loginPage) 
    which creates new branch and switches to it immediately
10) Then after commit, push to branch {git push -u origin features/loginPage} -u sets the upstream so next time you can just do git push

✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅//Install Allure:✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅
1) npm install --save-dev allure-playwright allure-commandline
2) Setup in your playwright.config.ts file
     // ✅ Allure + HTML reporters
    reporter: [
        ['list'],
        ['html', { open: 'never', outputFolder: 'test-results/html-report' }],
        ['allure-playwright']
    ],
3) update your package.json under scripts
    "scripts": {
  "test": "npx playwright test",
  "test:headed": "npx playwright test --headed",
  "test:debug": "npx playwright test --headed --trace on",
  "test:ui": "npx playwright test --grep @ui",
  "test:api": "npx playwright test --grep @api",
  "allure:generate": "allure generate ./allure-results --clean -o ./test-results/allure-report",
  "allure:open": "allure open ./test-results/allure-report"
}

✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅//Common git commands:✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅
Check branch {git branch}
Verify remote connection {git remote -v}
future commits {git add --> git commit --> git push}
** Or combine them with git add . && git commit -m "message"
Then it push -u origin feature/login for example
** For git hygiene, if you are done merging the branch and start a new branch, delete the old one to prevent clutter:
git checkout main
git pull origin main (pulls the latest main after the branch was merged)
git branch -d feature/login
git push origin --delete feature/login (deletes the branch on github)
git checkout -b features/homepage (then you can start a new branch to work on)
